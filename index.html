1. Add a hamburger icon at the top for options.
2. Add an option to create an account so that user doesn't have to see the first splash page. Perhaps have the option for a note to save to the account or save to a linked iCloud of Dropbox account.
3. Consider putting the paragraph in the About section and have the main page be soley for notes.

    This is a site for your thoughts. If you're like me, you'll have a neat idea or memory during the day and won't have pen and paper nearby. You then convince yourself you'll remember to tell your significant other about it. And then it's gone forever. Now, you'll be able to go to this site from any device, jot down your quick thoughts, and send it to yourself via email. Also, no emails are stored. Once you've submitted it, it's gone (to you and only you!). </p>
